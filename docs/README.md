This is my personal website where I compile my engineering notes. I started writing since 2017 when I am juggling between understanding complex technologies and busy work life. My notes was all over the place at that time and it was difficult for me to connect the dots when time requires. So this website is an effort to build bridges between the scattered puzzles.
